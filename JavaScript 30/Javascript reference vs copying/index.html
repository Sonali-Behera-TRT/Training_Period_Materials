			// Let's say we have an array
			const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

			// and we want to make a copy of it.

			// You might think we can just do something like this:

			// however what happens when we update that array?

			// now here is the problem!

			// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

			const p1 = players;
			console.log(players, p1);

			players[0] = "Sonali";
			console.log(players, p1);

			// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

			// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

			// one way
			const p2 = players.slice();
			p1[0] = "wes";
			console.log(p2, players);

			// or create a new array and concat the old one in
			const p3 = [].concat(players);
			p3[0] = "Monali";
			console.log(p3, players);

			// or use the new ES6 Spread
			const p4 = [...players];
			players[1] = "behera";
			console.log(p4, players);

			// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

			// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

			// with Objects
			const person = {
				name: "Wes Bos",
				age: 80,
			};

			// and think we make a copy:
			const p5 = person;
			console.log(person, p5);
			person.name = "Sonali Behera";
			console.log(person, p5);

			// how do we take a copy instead?

			// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
			const p6 = { ...person };
			console.log(p6, person);

			p6.age = 22;
			console.log(p6, person);

			const p7 = Object.assign({}, person, { year: 2001 });
			console.log(p7, person);

			p7.age = 22;
			console.log(p7, person);

			const p8 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
			console.log(p8, person);

			p8.year = 22;
			console.log(p8, person);
			// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
