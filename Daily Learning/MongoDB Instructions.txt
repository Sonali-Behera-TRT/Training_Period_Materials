Connecting MongoDB to Nestjs application

Step1: Installing dependecies
- We need to install dependecies like @nestjs/mongoose and mongoose. 
- Here @nestjs/mongoose is the npm package that includes methods to integrate mongodb with nestjs application and mongoose is the dedicated package containing all the mongodb methods.

Step2: Connecting to MongoDB
- We need to import MongooseModule into our application using the syntax 
import { MongooseModule } from '@nestjs/mongoos';
- Then we need to mention it in the import array inside our AppModule and connect to the MongoDB database using the following syntax:
import: [MongooseModule.forRoot(process.env.MONGODB_URI)] 
Here the forRoot method shares the database connection with all other modules inside our application.

Step3: Creating a Mongoose schema
- Now our database connection part is done. We need to create schema of our table like we created entity in case of postgres. 
- We can create a <name>.schema.ts file and mention all schema of the table that will be a class annotated with @Schema() decorator. 
- We can also mention the properties or columns of the table using @Prop() decorator.
- Further we can see mongoose documentation for further application.
